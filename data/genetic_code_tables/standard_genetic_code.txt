===================================================================

SPECIAL CODONS:
- START CODON: AUG (codes for Methionine)
- STOP CODONS: UAA (Ochre), UAG (Amber), UGA (Opal)

AMINO ACID CLASSIFICATION:
- Hydrophobic: A, V, I, L, M, F, W, P
- Polar: S, T, C, Y, N, Q
- Charged Positive: K, R, H
- Charged Negative: D, E
- Special: G (smallest), P (constrains backbone)

WOBBLE BASE PAIRING:
Third codon position shows degeneracy:
- Same amino acid often shares first two positions
- Allows for mutation tolerance
- Enables codon optimization for expression

CODON USAGE:
Different organisms prefer different synonymous codons
Important for:
- Heterologous protein expression
- Synthetic biology design
- Evolutionary studies
