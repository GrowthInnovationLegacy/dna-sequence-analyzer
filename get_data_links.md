1. NCBI GenBank (Recommended for beginners)
```
Website: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/

Steps:
1. Go to NCBI Nucleotide database
2. Search for organism (e.g., "Escherichia coli K12")
3. Filter by "Complete Genome" or "mRNA"
4. Click on result → "Send to" → "File" → Format: FASTA
5. Save and upload to application
```
2. Ensembl Genome Browser

```
Website: https://www.ensembl.org/

Steps:
1. Select species (Human, Mouse, etc.)
2. Search for gene (e.g., "BRCA1")
3. Click "Export Data" → FASTA sequence
4. Choose: cDNA, Genomic sequence, or Protein
5. Download and use in analyzer
```
3. UniProt (for protein-coding sequences)

```
Website: https://www.uniprot.org/

Steps:
1. Search protein name
2. Click entry → "Sequence" tab
3. "Download" → FASTA format
4. Get coding DNA sequence from linked databases
